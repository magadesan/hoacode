B.1.1. Introduction. Declarant intends the Declaration to be perpetual and understands
that provisions pertaining to the initial development, construction, marketing, and control of the
Property will become obsolete when Declarant's role is complete. As a courtesy to future users
of the Declaration, who may be frustrated by then-obsolete terms, Declarant is compiling the
Declarant-related provisions in this Exhibit. Owners are put on notice that throughout the
Declaration and its exhibits the intention shall be that during the Declarant Control Period all
restrictions, rules, regulations, policies and any other provision governing the Association shall be
interpreted so as to be in the favor of the Declarant and the Builders. This is necessary to ensure
the continual and smooth buildout of the Subdivision. The Declarant's decision on any matter
shall be final and shall not be subject to the discretion, opinion, or interference of any Class A
Member.
B.1.2. General Reservation & Construction. Notwithstanding other provisions of the
Documents to the contrary, nothing contained therein may be construed to, nor may any
mortgagee, other Owner, or the Association, prevent or interfere with the rights contained in this
Exhibit which Declarant hereby reserves exclusively unto itself and its successors and assigns. In
case of conflict between this Exhibit and any other Document, this Exhibit controls. This Exhibit
may not be amended without the prior written consent of Declarant. To the extent any proposed
amendment is for the purpose of either amending the provisions of this Declaration or the

facilities, structures, improvements, systems, Common Properties, private Streets or grounds that
are the responsibility of the Association, prior written consent of the City may be required. The

BA. COMMON PROPERTIES. Declarant will convey title to the Common Properties,
including any and all facilities, structures, improvements and systems of the Common Properties
owned by Declarant, to the Association by one or more deeds â€” with or without warranty and in
"As Is" condition, at the end of the Declarant Control Period. Any initial improvements within
or that are part of the Common Properties will be installed, constructed, or authorized by Declarant,
the cost of which is not a Common Expense of the Association. At the time of conveyance to the
Association, the Common Properties will be free to encumbrance except for the property taxes
accruing for the year of conveyance the terms of this Declaration and matters reflected on the Plat.
Declarant's conveyance of title is a ministerial task that does not require and is not subject to
acceptance by the Association or the Owners. The transfer of control of the Association at the
end of the Declarant Control Period is not a transfer of Common Properties requiring inspection,
evaluation, acceptance, or approval of improvements within or that are part of the Common
Properties by the Owners. Declarant is under no contractual or other obligation to provide
amenities of any kind or type.
B.5. WORKING CAPITAL FUND. Declarant may (but is not required to) establish a working
capital fund for the Association by requiring purchasers of Lots to make a one-time contribution
to this fund, subject to the following conditions:
a.
Subject to the foregoing a Lot's contribution should be collected from any Owner
at closing excluding Lot sales from Declarant to Builders. Declarant acknowledges that this
condition may create an inequity among the Owners, but deems it a necessary response to the
diversification of marketing and closing Lot sales.
b.
Contributions to the fund are not advance payments of Regular Assessments or
Special Assessments and are not refundable to the contributor by the Association or by Declarant.
This may not be construed to prevent a selling Owner from negotiating reimbursement of the
contribution from a purchaser. Working Capital Funds may be used for any expense or need of
the Association.
c.
Declarant will transfer the balance of the working capital fund to the Association
on or before termination of the Declarant Control Period. Declarant may not use the fund to
defray Declarant's personal expenses or construction costs however, Declarant may, if necessary,
utilize funds for the Association's operating needs in the event of a deficit in the Association's
operating budget.
B.6. SUCCESSOR DECLARANT.
Declarant may designate one or more Successor
Declarants' (herein so called) for specified designated purposes and/or for specified portions of the
Property, or for all purposes and all of the Property. To be effective, the designation must be in
writing, signed and acknowledged by Declarant and Successor Declarant, and recorded in the Real
Property Records of Collin County, Texas. Declarant (or Successor Declarant) may subject the
designation of Successor Declarant to limitations and reservations. Unless the designation of
Successor Declarant provides otherwise, a Successor Declarant has the rights of Declarant under

affiliates and/or any of their respective successors and assigns the right to annex any real property

contrary, Declarant and/or such affiliates, successors and/or assigns, subject to annexation of same
into the real property, shall have the exclusive unilateral right, privilege and option (but never an

Property Subject to Annexation, to annex (a) all or any portion of the Property Subject to
Annexation owned by Declarant, and (b) subject to the provisions of this Declaration and the
jurisdiction of the Association, any additional property located adjacent to or in the immediate
vicinity of the Property (collectively, the "Annexed Land"), by filing in the Official Public Records
of Collin County, Texas, a Supplemental Declaration expressly annexing any such Annexed Land.
Such Supplemental Declaration shall not require the vote of the Owners, the Members of the
Association, or approval by the Board or other action of the Association or any other Person,
subject to the prior annexation of such Annexed Land into the real property. Any such annexation
shall be effective upon the filing of such Supplemental Declaration in the Official Public Records
of Collin County, Texas (with consent of Owner(s) of the Annexed Land, if not Declarant).
Declarant shall also have the unilateral right to transfer to any successor Declarant, Declarant's
right, privilege and option to annex Annexed Land, provided that such successor Declarant shall
be the developer of at least a portion of the Annexed Land and shall be expressly designated by
Declarant in writing to be the successor or assignee to all or any part of Declarant's rights
hereunder.
B.7.1. Procedure for Annexation. Any such annexation shall be accomplished by the
execution by Declarant, and the filing for record by Declarant (or the other Owner of the
property being added or annexed, to the extent such other Owner has received a written
assignment from Declarant of the right to annex hereunder) of a Supplemental Declaration
which must set out and provide for the following:
(i)

A legally sufficient description of the Annexed Land being added or annexed,
which Annexed Land must as a condition precedent to such annexation be included
in the real property;

(ii)

That the Annexed Land is being annexed in accordance with and subject to the
provisions of this Declaration, and that the Annexed Land being annexed shall be
developed, held, used, sold and conveyed in accordance with, and subject to, the
provisions of this Declaration as theretofore and thereafter amended; provided,
however, that if any Lots or portions thereof being so annexed are to be treated
differently than any of the other Lots (whether such difference is applicable to other
Lots included therein or to the Lots now subject to this Declaration), the
Supplemental Declaration should specify the details of such differential treatment
and a general statement of the rationale and reasons for the difference in treatment,
and if applicable, any other special or unique covenants, conditions, restrictions,
easements or other requirements as may be applicable to all or any of the Lots or
other portions of Annexed Land being annexed;

Exhibit B â€” Page 8

That all of the provisions of this Declaration, as amended, shall apply to the
Annexed Land being added or annexed with the same force and effect as if said
Annexed Land were originally included in this Declaration as part of the Initial
Property, with the total number of Lots increased accordingly;
(iv)

That an Assessment Lien is therein created and reserved in favor of the Association
to secure collection of the Assessments as provided in this Declaration, and as
provided for, authorized or contemplated in the Supplemental Declaration, and
setting forth the first year Maintenance Assessments and the amount of any other
then applicable Assessments (if any) for the Lots within the Annexed Land being
made subject to this Declaration; and

(v)

Such other provisions as the Declarant therein shall deem appropriate.

B.7.2. Amendment. The provisions of this B.7. or its sub-sections may not be amended
without the express written consent of Declarant (and Declarant's successors and assigns
in accordance with the terms hereof).
B.7.3. No Duty to Annex. Nothing herein contained shall establish any duty or
obligation on the part of the Declarant or any Member to annex any property to this
Declaration and no Owner of the property excluded from this Declaration shall have any
right to have such property annexed thereto.
B.7.4. Effect of Annexation on Class B Membership. In determining the number of Lots
owned by the Declarant for the purpose of Class B Membership status the total number of
Lots covered by this Declaration and located in such Declarant's portion of the Property,
including all Lots acquired by the Declarant and annexed thereto, shall be considered. If
Class B Membership has previously lapsed but annexation of additional property restores
the ratio of Lots owned by the Declarant to the number required by Class B Membership,
such Class B Membership shall be reinstated until it expires pursuant to the telins of the
Declaration.
