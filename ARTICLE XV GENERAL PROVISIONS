If any provision herein contained shall be invalid, which invalidity shall not be presumed

This Declaration is for the mutual benefit of, and shall be binding upon, each and every
person acquiring any part of the Property, it being understood that the covenants, conditions,
restrictions, easements, and other provisions contained in this Declaration are not for the benefit

every Owner or purchaser of any portion of the Property is on notice of the covenants, conditions,
restrictions, easements, and other provisions herein contained.
Section 15.5 Notices.
Any notices or correspondence to an Owner shall be addressed to the street address of the
Lot or to such other address as is specified by any such Owner in writing to the Association. The

addressed to the registered office of the Association as shown by the records of the Secretary of
State for the State of Texas or to such other address as is specified by the Association in writing to
the Owners. Except as this Declaration or the Bylaws otherwise provide, all notices, demands,

by United States mail; or, if the intended recipient has given its prior written authorization to use
such method of delivery, by facsimile or electronic mail with written confirmation of transmission.
Notices sent in accordance with this Declaration shall be deemed to have been duly given
and effective:

Section 15.6 Transfer Under Deed of Trust.
Upon any transfer of Declarant's interest in and to the Property, or any part thereof, under
the teâ–ºius of any deed of trust lien upon the Property, whether voluntary or involuntary, by
foreclosure, deed in lieu of foreclosure or otherwise, all rights, title and interests of Declarant under
this Declaration, shall be transferred to and devolve upon the party to whom the Property or any
part thereof, is thereby conveyed.
Section 15.7 Notice of Transfer.
If at any time a Lot is sold, the new Owner shall have the sole obligation to promptly notify
the Association of the name and address of the new Owner and shall be responsible for any cost,
charge or expense added to the account of such Owner which may have otherwise been avoided if
the above information was promptly delivered to the Association.
Section 15.8 No Liability for Trespass.
Whenever the Association, the Board of Directors or Declarant exercises any right
hereunder and in connection therewith enters upon any Lot, such parties shall not be liable for
trespass upon such Lot.
Section 15.9 Lien Priority.
Notwithstanding any other provision of the Declaration, the lien to secure the payment of
assessments and any other lien which the Association may have on any Lot pursuant to the
Declaration for (a) assessments or other charges becoming payable on or after the date of
recordation of the first mortgage or deed of trust on any Lot, or (b) any fees, late charges, fines or
interest that may be levied by the Association in connection with unpaid assessments, shall be
subordinate to the lien or equivalent security interest of any legitimate third-party first lien
mortgage or deed of trust on any Lot, if any. Any foreclosure of any such superior lien under the
power of sale of any mortgage, deed of trust or other security instrument, or through court
proceedings in which the Association has been made a party, shall extinguish the liens securing
maintenance charges or assessments which became due and payable prior to such foreclosure date,
but no such foreclosure shall free any Lot from the liens securing assessments thereafter becoming
due and payable, nor shall the liability of any Owner personally obligated to pay maintenance
charges or assessments which become due prior to such foreclosure be extinguished by any
foreclosure, nor shall the lien for future assessments or changes be affected in any manner. Any
such maintenance charges or assessments which are extinguished pursuant to the foregoing
provision shall be reallocated and assessed to all Lots as a common expense.
Section 15.10 Use of Recreational Facilities and Other Common Properties.
The property made subject to this Declaration may contain common recreational facilities
available for the use and enjoyment of Owners of all or any part of the Property, including Lots
and residences, within the Subdivision, their families, tenants and other occupants of their
property, and the guests of any such persons. EACH OWNER, BY ACCEPTANCE OF A
DEED TO ANY PORTION OF THE PROPERTY MADE SUBJECT TO THIS
64

DECLARATION, ACKNOWLEDGES THAT THE USE AND ENJOYMENT OF ANY
RECREATIONAL FACILITY OR ANY OTHER PORTION OF THE COMMON
PROPERTIES INVOLVES RISK OF PERSONAL INJURY, DEATH, OR DAMAGE TO
PROPERTY. Each Owner acknowledges, understands, and covenants to inform his or her
family members, and tenants and other occupants of Owner's property that Declarant, the
Association, the Board and any committees, and Builders constructing residences and other
improvements within the Property are not insurers of personal safety. EACH PERSON USING
SUCH RECREATIONAL FACILITIES OR ANY OTHER PORTION OF THE COMMON
PROPERTIES ASSUMES ALL RISKS OF PERSONAL INJURY, DEATH, AND LOSS OR
DAMAGE TO PROPERTY, RESULTING FROM THE USE AND ENJOYMENT OF ANY
RECREATIONAL FACILITY OR OTHER PORTION OF THE COMMON
PROPERTIES.
Each Owner agrees that Declarant, the Association, the Board and committees, and Builders within
the Subdivision shall not be liable to any person claiming any loss or damage, including, without
limitation, indirect, special or consequential loss or damage arising from personal injury or death,
destruction of property, trespass, loss of enjoyment, or any other wrong or entitlement to remedy
based upon, due to, arising from, or otherwise relating to the use of any recreational facility or
other portions of the Common Properties, including, without limitation, any claim arising in whole
or in part from the negligence of Declarant, the Association, or any Builder within the Subdivision.
THE FOREGOING RELEASE IS INTENDED TO RELEASE THE SPECIFIED PARTIES
FROM LIABILITY FOR THEIR OWN NEGLIGENCE.
EACH OWNER ACKNOWLEDGES AND AGREES THAT THE ABOVE
RELEASE FROM LIABILITY IS CONSIDERATION FOR, AND A CONDITION TO,
THE USE AND ENJOYMENT OF THE RECREATIONAL FACILITIES AND OTHER
COMMON PROPERTIES WITHIN THE SUBDIVISION AND THAT THIS
ACKNOWLEDGMENT AND AGREEMENT IS A MATERIAL INDUCEMENT TO
DECLARANT AND BUILDERS TO SELL, CONVEY, LEASE, AND/OR ALLOW THE
USE OF LOTS WITHIN THE SUBDIVISION. ANY VIOLATION OF THIS RELEASE
AGREEMENT BY AN OWNER, OR ANY OF OWNER'S FAMILY MEMBERS,
TENANTS AND OTHER OCCUPANTS OF OWNER'S PROPERTY, OR THEIR
RESPECTIVE GUESTS SHALL BE GROUNDS FOR THE SUSPENSION OR
TERMINATION OF ALL OF SUCH PERSONS' USE PRIVILEGES IN SUCH
FACILITIES.
Section 15.11 Construction of Declaration and All Association Documents.
The provisions of this Declaration and all other documents of the Association shall be
liberally construed to give effect to its intended purpose. All doubts regarding the meaning,
significance or effect of a provision in this Declaration or other documents of the Association,
shall be resolved in favor of the operation of the Association and its enforcement of the
Declaration.
